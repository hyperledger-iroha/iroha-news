Dear Iroha Community,

Here are some highlights on our progress over the past month:

- **Query improvements**
  - It's now possible to inspect the number of items produced by a query without requesting all batches.
  - Added support for block and transaction predicates. This allows filtering by transaction hash, block hash, and the account ID of the transaction submitter.
  - Added missing APIs and improved consistency for query parameters.
  - Removed redundant queries, shrinking the API surface.
- **Core improvements**
  - Blocks have a bounded concept of time synchronized across peers. A sequence of blocks is now guaranteed to have monotonically increasing timestamps. Details [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4928#issuecomment-2265015859).
  - View change proof is now sent only for the latest change instead of for every change within the current block height. This reduces redundant data transfer, lessening the load on peers.
- **Code quality**
  - Fixed/improved flaky tests, making CI more reliable.
