Dear Iroha Community,

Here are some highlights on our progress over the past two weeks:

- Updated the [Getting Started](https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-2-docs/guide/get-started/) section of the documentation to the latest version of Iroha.
- Introduced an async task supervisor, simplifying peer lifecycle while making error handling more robust.
- Reorganized the codebase.
  - The crate of the `iroha` binary is now called `iroha_cli` (previously `iroha_client_cli`).
  - The crate of the `kagami` binary is now called `iroha_kagami` (previously `kagami`).
  - The crate of the `iroha_wasm_builder` binary is now also called `iroha_wasm_builder`.
  - `parity_scale_cli` is now called `iroha_codec`.
