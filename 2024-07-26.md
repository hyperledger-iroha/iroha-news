Dear Iroha Community,

We made one more pre-MVP release, `2.0.0-pre-rc.22.0`. You can see the complete changelog [on GitHub](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/releases/tag/v2.0.0-pre-rc.22.0).

Here are some highlights on our progress over the past two weeks (included in the release):

- Kura locking mechanism has been removed, which allows Iroha to restart after a non-graceful shutdown.
- Memory utilization has been improved by removing committed topology data from blocks.
- Voting block validation has been improved, reducing false rejection.
