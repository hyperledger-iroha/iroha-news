Dear Iroha Community,

Here are some highlights on our progress over the past two weeks:

- The pre-signed genesis block is now submitted by all peers without intercommunication, which allows them to start participating in consensus faster.
- Accounts are [no longer nested](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4734) in Domains. This is the first step in [making the objects in Iroha's data model shallow](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/3921), which will improve performance and memory usage.
- `Metadata` no longer maps keys to specific value types, instead deferring the parsing of values to the executor [by mapping to JSON strings](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4732).
- `iroha_swarm` (the Docker Compose configuration generator for Iroha networks) [has been optimized](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4719). Previously, configurations building Iroha images locally did so for each service, which caused the out-of-memory killer to kick in. From now on, such configurations build the image only once.

### Changelog

* refactor!: Supply `SignedBlock` instead of `SignedTransaction` to peer ([#4739](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4739))
* refactor!: revert `_ms` and `_bytes` suffixes in config ([#4667](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4667))
