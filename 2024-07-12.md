Dear Iroha Community,

Here are some highlights on our progress over the past two weeks:

- Triggers can now be used to model multi-signature transactions. An example of this has been provided [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4788).
- Executor's data model [has been separated](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4791) into its own crate. Permissions are now strongly-typed, and are no longer defined at runtime with string identifiers and JSON payloads.
- On-chain Parameter API [has been refined](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4731), improving type-safety and differentiation between built-in and custom parameters.
- Torii (HTTP/WebSocket gateway) implementation [has been migrated](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4718) from `warp` to `axum`, making it simpler.
