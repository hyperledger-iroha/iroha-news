Dear Iroha Community,

Here are some highlights on our progress over the past month:

- **Type-safe queries** ([#4833](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4833))
  - Queries are now split into _iterable_ (return sequences) and _singular_ (return single values) types, with distinct handling for each.
  - Predicate types are specific to the query type, with a new Rust DSL for easier predicate construction (similar to `std::iter::Iterator::filter`).
  - HTTP clients and WASM smart contracts now use a common, generic query builder struct.
  - Queries that can be implemented as filtered versions of other queries are now removed.

- **Bugfixes, performance and QOL improvements**:
  - refactor!: remove `event_recommendations` from block ([#4932](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4932))
  - refactor: rename `configs` directory to `defaults`, remove `swarm` directory ([#4862](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4862))
  - refactor: Simplify `/health` and `/api_version` ([#4960](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4960))
  - perf: Don't validate transactions inside WASM ([#4995](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4995))
  - perf: Fix cloning of executor ([#4955](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4955))
  - fix(client): Fix torii url with path ([#4903](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4903))
  - fix(p2p): prevent deadlock on simultaneous sending large message ([#4948](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4948))
  - fix(sumeragi): remove expired transaction from cache ([#4922](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4922))
  - fix(torii): display more error details ([#4973](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4973))
  - fix(torii): use `GET` for blocks stream ([#4990](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4990))
  - fix: Add limits to `LiveQueryStore` to prevent high memory usage ([#4893](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4893))
  - fix: add missing mathematical operations to `Numeric` ([#4976](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4976))
  - fix: Improve queue transactions handling ([#4947](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4947))
  - fix: prevent redundant blocksync block messages ([#4909](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4909))
  - fix: validate block sync messages ([#4965](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4965))
