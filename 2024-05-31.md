Dear Iroha Community,

It's time for us to share some updates on the progress of Iroha. We've made major strides towards [`2.0.0-rc.1`](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/milestone/4) over the past two weeks:

Singular and iterable queries have been separated into their own traits: users can no longer add filters, sorting, batching or pagination to singular queries at compile time (this was a runtime error previously). The permission schema has been generalized, making it part of the customizable executor data model â€“ this enables implementation of user-defined instructions, parameters, and metadata. Configuration system has been greatly improved through a new `ConfigReader` API, its debuggability enhanced via better error-reporting and logging. Finally, Iroha crates and binaries have been renamed: `irohad` for the peer crate/binary, `iroha` for the client crate/CLI.
