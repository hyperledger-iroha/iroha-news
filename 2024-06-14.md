Dear Iroha Community,

Here are some highlights on our progress over the past two weeks:

- Support for **custom instructions** via executor upgrades [has landed](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4645). This allows users to expand the instruction set beyond the built-in ISI.
- Genesis signing [has been removed](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/4673) from Iroha: the signed genesis block is now provided on startup. This simplifies network initialization, ensures consistent configuration, and improves consensus security.
