Dear Iroha Community,

Here are some highlights on our progress over the past two weeks:

- Iroha repositories have been migrated to the [`hyperledger-iroha`](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha) organization. You can find `iroha` [here](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha).
  - The documentation can be found [here](https://hyperledger-iroha.github.io/iroha-2-docs/), or at [docs.iroha.tech](https://docs.iroha.tech/).
- Better support for multi-signature transactions: recursion, quorum and weighted approvals, new client CLI subcommands, time-to-live, [and more](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/pull/5027).
- Peer-to-peer communication is now address-agnostic. The network will keep working if a peer changes its address. See [#5176](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/5176) for migration details.
- The whole block header is now available inside smart contracts. Previously, only the block height was present in the context.
- Transactions can now be queried in descending order by their creation time.
