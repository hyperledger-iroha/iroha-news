Dear Iroha Community,

Here are some highlights on our progress over the past two weeks:

- Block commit time is now dynamic based on the view change index. This allows the consensus to operate in the presence of heavy transactions.
- Consensus estimation for time trigger execution has been removed, making use of the guarantees provided by discrete blockchain time.
- The default permission set has been updated.
- Smart contracts now interact with Iroha using a client-like entity. This unifies development experience between smart contracts and HTTP clients.
- From now on, only N last blocks are stored in memory (128 by default), with the rest loaded from the disk on demand. This improves memory usage from 1.6KB/tx or 1.6GB/1mil txs to approximately 280 bytes/tx or 0.26GB/1mil txs.
- The integration tests framework and suite underwent a [major overhaul](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/5124). Iroha is now tested as a black-box, and much faster.
